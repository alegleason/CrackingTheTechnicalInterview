// For this problem, to get the maximum number of pairs I lean on the pigeons theorem, which says that if n doves are distributed on m dovecotes, and if n > m, then it will be at least a dovecote with more than one dove. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principio_del_palomar. So the max. number of pairs would be the min number of 'n' or 'm' + 1.

int main() {
    int n, m, pt;//pt stands for pidgeons theorem
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    //not used... (better to have each case uniquely)
    //pt = min(n, m);
    //pt += 1;
    //cout << pt << endl;
    
    // We will use the formula for the distance between two points, which is square root based, ensuring non integers. https://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/links/formulas/form2.pdf
    
    if(n == m) { // si n y m son iguales
        cout << n+1 << endl;
        // The principle follows that we can increase on x (which starts on 0) and decrease on y, which starts on m, while y is bigger than 0 (non negatives), since x+y>0.
